## 🔨 Training

All datasets and their contents from AdaptEval are defined in the `dataset_info.json` file included in this repository. You only need to specify the desired dataset in your configuration file to use it.

For example, to adapt to the geography dataset:
- For offline test-time learning, you can start training with the following command:
```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 llamafactory-cli train examples/train_lora/offline_ttl.yaml
```
- For online test-time learning, use:
```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 llamafactory-cli train examples/train_lora/online_ttl.yaml
```
The `offline_ttl.yaml` and `online_ttl.yaml` files provide example configurations for fine-tuning with test-time learning. These configurations specify parameters about model, fine-tuning method, dataset, TTL method and so on. Please customize these files according to your own requirements.

## ⚖️ Evaluation

After running the above training commands, you will obtain the model inference results in the specified `output_dir`. You can then evaluate these results.

First, install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install rouge_score rouge-chinese bert_score git+https://github.com/google-research/bleurt.git
```
All evaluation-related scripts are located in the `scripts/eval` folder:
- For datasets in DomainBench and InstructionBench, copy the path to your model inference results into `eval_simility.py` and run the script.
- For datasets in ReasoningBench, copy the path to your model inference results into `eval_accuracy.py` and run the script.
